                            <p class="card-text">Originally named after a rock that resembled an elephant, during the British era, this stunning waterfall is composed of three falls. While the first fall is a broad one and concealed by trees, the second one is weak. However, the third one catches the eye with milky white water happily cascading over rocks that are covered in fern. With thick vegetation on either side, Elephant Falls can be accessed by carefully descending along slippery and steep steps</p>

                            <p class="card-text">The rainy season is the best time to visit this dramatic waterfall that descends from a height of 315m and is among the tallest falls in the country. As the name suggests, it has seven segments that are fed by rainwater and gush powerfully over limestone cliffs in the East Khasi Hills. The verdant green surroundings and the play of sunlight on the cascading water (watch out for the rainbow effect), make for an enchanting view</p>

You can spend some time watching vibrant fishes and cute ducks in the lake here.

They get ample natural light for you to get around without torches, during the day. While tourists can explore up to 150 metres, the rest of the caves are closed</p>
